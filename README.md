#Welcome! :joy: I am Marcia Harris


      I was born and raised in Newark, NJ and I got my degree in Fashion Studies from Montclair State University.
      **I was a pandemic graduate.**
      But I commenced work as a visual merchandiser pretty quickly after graduating:
      _I'm excited to be beginning a new career!_
    
      This is a photo of Frida Khalo's beautiful self portrait because I have no current headshot.

    ###I am a 2023 Web Development Fellow with the Knowledge House!

      I'm currently working as a store consultant at Fedex, hoping to get a entry level Web Development position at the conclusion of this cohort. I've attached my linkedin which will be updated accurately soon!
